# COVID91 Project
In this project I analysed a COVID19 dataset from "Our World In Data" using SQL, and then visualized it using Tableau.

The dataset is still updated daily and it can be found here: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

Instead of using the most updated data I have decided to use the dataset from 22/02/2022. It is smaller in size which made it much more user friendly and easier to use.

What I did, step by step:

* Download the csv file
* Convert the file and import it to MySQL
* Perform EDA
* Visualize it using Tableau
